Please run hw3.py with python2.
Please add the parts you want to execute as a command line arguments - 1, 2, 3

You can send few arguments in one run - 3, 1
You can send 'all' argument to run all of them

The outputs are 8 plots that saved in png format in the same directory as the python file located.

part a runs in less than 3 mins thanks to few optimizations:
The distances for each image in the test set is calculated just once, and for each k just the first k elements are taking into consideration.
The distances are saved in order so entering a new element is just log k what relief the time to n*log k instead of n*log n
In part d, the last calculation is re-used, each time 100 training added to the already existed result without calculating the whole set from zero.


Enjoy your day,
Ido & Matan :)
